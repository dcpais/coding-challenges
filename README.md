# Coding Challenge Solutions

Welcome to my coding challenge solutions repository! Here, you'll find a collection of my solutions to various coding problems and puzzles from platforms like LeetCode and coding competitions like Advent of Code. This repository serves a personal archive of my solutions.

## Getting Started

To explore the solutions:

1. **Navigate Through Folders**: Folders are named based on the platform / competition the problem arised from. Solutions are usually done in python, sometimes the actual problem statement might not be present.
3. **Run Code (Optional)**: If you wish to run the code locally, ensure you have the necessary dependencies installed for the programming language used.

## Disclaimer

Please note that these solutions are provided for reference purposes only. They may not always represent the most optimal or efficient solutions, as the primary goal is to demonstrate problem-solving approaches and techniques.

Happy coding!
